                <h2 class="hero-post-h2"> How I got started</h2>
                <p class="hero-post-para">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.

                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
